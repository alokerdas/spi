# spi
Serial Peripheral Interface
This is a very slim implementation of SPI protocol. This is taped out and manufactured in GF180 nm technology. This is one ip written carefully to work as master and slave configuration. It's easy to integrated with other ip. It can be configured as master or slave during integration. Also the hard ip can be configured without any changes in the RTL. As a stand alone chip also it can be configured as master or slave while on pcb.
